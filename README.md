## My process

I started writing the html so i can fully concentrate in the css afterwards, then i used some custom properties for the styles provided in the [style-guide.md](./style-guide.md), afterwards i added some simple resets for my project and then i proceeded with my styles in the order that can be seen in the css file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I try using some custom properties to use the styles that i got provided and have them in hand

### Continued development

I feel that i could use more custom properties in future projects and attempt to refine my naming, aswell as the utilites that i can give them
